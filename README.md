TaskFlow: Your Ultimate Task Management Solution
Why I Built This
Managing tasks across different platforms like Slack and Trello always felt scattered. I wanted to create something that pulls everything together into one place TaskFlow! It not only helps teams track their tasks but also integrates with other tools, so no task gets lost in the shuffle. The idea was born out of my own frustrations and a desire to streamline workflow.
Project Setup
TaskFlow is built with modern technologies for a smooth and scalable user experience. This was my first time working with both React.js on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend.
Technical Setup
1.	Backend: Built with Node.js and Express, the server handles task management and API integrations.
2.	Frontend: Designed with React.js, the user interface is dynamic and responsive.
3.	Database: Data persistence is handled by MongoDB, which stores user info and task details.
Key Features
•	Task Management: Create, update, and delete tasks.
•	Integrations: Sync with Asana and Trello for updates.
•	Simple UI: Built with React.js for ease of use and speed.
Backend Architecture
The backend is set up with Express to handle API routes for tasks and integrations. Here's a glimpse of how the backend works:
•	Express Server: The server listens on port 3000 and handles basic task operations like listing all tasks.
•	Database Integration: I used Mongoose to connect MongoDB for storing tasks and user info.

Frontend Design
The React.js frontend brings the app to life with reusable components like TaskList, which displays all tasks. 
Why React.js?
React allowed me to create reusable components, making it easier to build and maintain the UI. The goal was to ensure tasks are clearly displayed and easily manageable.
Integration with Asana and Trello
One of the biggest challenges was integrating with third-party tools. I used Axios to send API requests to Asana and Trello.
Why Axios? It’s simple, lightweight, and works perfectly for HTTP requests in this case.
Testing
Testing was done using Jest for the backend and Cypress for the frontend. This ensured that all features worked smoothly before deploying the app.
Deployment
I deployed the backend to Heroku and the frontend to Netlify. This was my first time working with these platforms, and they made deployment pretty straightforward.
Challenges and Lessons Learned
The integration part was tricky, especially when dealing with third-party APIs like Asana’s. But working through those challenges taught me the importance of thorough documentation and testing.
Next up, I plan to:
•	Add notifications for task deadlines.
•	Improve the UI for a better user experience.
•	Incorporate more project management features like Kanban boards.
Conclusion
Building TaskFlow was an exciting journey! I learned a lot about full-stack development, handling third-party integrations, and improving user experience. This is just the first version, and I can’t wait to improve it further!
